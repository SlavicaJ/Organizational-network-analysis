# Organizational Network Analysis (ONA)
![image](/figures/Organizational network.jpg)

In every organization, people build and rely on informally-built networks seeking for information, advice, and collaborations. Often the invisible people networks are different from the formal organization hierarchy. Uncovering the informal but effective networks and understanding how information in the organization flows become crucial and enormously valuable to organization leaders.

In [this article] (https://ai-journey.com/2019/04/organizational-network-analysis/), we will briefly explain what Organization Network Analysis (ONA) is about and how to effectively measure. A small sample dataset is used to demonstrate our ONA experiment and network graph.Build a simple data-science-skill-keyword-based job recommendation engine, which match keywords from resume to data science jobs in major Canadian cities.
